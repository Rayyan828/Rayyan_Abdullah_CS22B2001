# ChatGPT Usage Transparency

This project was developed with the help of ChatGPT (GPT-5 by OpenAI) for:
- Structuring the architecture and project layout  
- Writing and debugging the Python backend (WebSocket ingestion, analytics pipeline)  
- Designing the Dash frontend structure and interactivity  
- Generating the architecture diagram and README documentation  

All code and logic were reviewed, tested, and modified by me to ensure full understanding and functionality.

**Prompts Used:**  
- "Quant Developer Evaluation Assignment — create app.py with Binance websocket, analytics, and Dash frontend"  
- "Fix statsmodels import error"  
- "How to create architecture.png and add to GitHub repo"  
- "How to package submission and prepare README for Quant Developer assignment"

This document acknowledges transparent usage of AI tools as per assignment guidelines.
